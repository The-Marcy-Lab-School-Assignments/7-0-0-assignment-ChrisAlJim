# Question

What is the return value of the `useState` hook in React? Be specific â€” just telling us the type is not enough.

# Answer

The return value of the `useState` hook is an array containing state data at index 0 and a setter function that will update the state data at index 1. The initial value for the state data is going to be whatever argument we pass into the `useState` hook. Depending on what you called the state data, the setter function should be called "set{state}" For example, if you called the data "burritos" you would call the function "setBurritos".
