# Question

In your own words, what is React and what are the benefits of using it?

# Answer

React is a Javascript library that helps build user-interfaces. It does this by allowing us to build components that can be used in other larger components. This allows it to be scaled efficiently which is a benefit of using React. Another benefit is that it can return HTML so that we don't have to use multiple lines of code to create an element like we do in the DOM API. This also allows it to be easier to read as well. An added benefit is that React has some performance benefits.
